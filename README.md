### Established the foundational codebase for the classic Snake game using Pygame.
### I envision enhancing this project by implementing an automated reinforcement learning model to play the game, ensuring scalability with additional input code.
### Stay tuned for updates as the project evolves to incorporate advanced features and optimizations. Feel free to contribute and join the journey of refining this Snake game implementation.
